### Links

- Solution URL: [Add solution URL here](https://your-solution-url.com)
- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I was able to get more comfortable using grid to create my layouts. I was stumped at first on how to get everything set up until I started looking at the 4 cards as 8 cards on a 6x4 grid...things became a lot easier.

### Continued development

I prefer to use grid because of the fact that it can work in multiple dimensions instead of one but I do enjoy learning to use flex too. For further development I will be looking into how to create more complex grid and flex combination designs as well.
